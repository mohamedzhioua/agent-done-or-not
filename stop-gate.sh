# stop-gate.sh — block "done" until it's proven.
#
# A Stop-event hook for Claude Code (and any harness with a stop/finish hook).
# It blocks the agent from ending its turn unless the MOST RECENT proof receipt
# (written by done-gate.sh) is a PASSING check that has not already been used to
# clear a previous stop. In plain terms:
#
#   "Your last recorded check must be a fresh, green one — or you can't say done."
#
# This is a FORCING FUNCTION, not a semantic oracle: it confirms a check ran and
# passed since your previous completion. It does not judge whether it was the
# RIGHT check — you choose that. (Semantic binding is on the v0.2 roadmap.)
#
# Trust model (hardened after independent review):
#   * FAIL CLOSED. Once a Stop payload is present, any missing / empty /
#     unparseable / stale proof state BLOCKS. Only an explicit disable, a
#     verified fresh passing receipt, or the anti-loop safety valve exits 0.
#   * No loop-guard bypass. We do NOT blanket-allow on stop_hook_active (that
#     would let the gate no-op after one block). Instead we bound consecutive
#     blocks per session with a counter; after AGENT_DONE_MAX_RETRIES we fail
#     OPEN with a loud warning purely to avoid an infinite stop loop.
#   * Freshness uses the epoch RECORDED IN the receipt, not the ledger's file
#     mtime (which `touch` could forge).
#   * Consume-on-allow persistence is MANDATORY: if we cannot record that a
#     receipt was used, we block rather than risk it being reused.
#
# Enable (Claude Code settings.json):
#   "hooks": { "Stop": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command",
#     "command": "bash \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/stop-gate.sh\"" }] }] }

# Knobs: AGENT_DONE_TTL (default 3600s), AGENT_DONE_MAX_RETRIES (default 10),
#        AGENT_DONE_DIR (default <repo>/.agent-proof).
#
# Exits:  0 = allow (disabled, verified receipt, or anti-loop safety valve).
#         2 = block.
